<title>HS Match Status Page</title>
<body>

This requires a 'Bracket ID'.  If you look at the URL of the match results page, it'll be something like the following:<p>
<tt>
https://battlefy.com/hsesports/hearthstone-masters-qualifier-las-vegas-153/5c5cb406f1f1730354f28d19/stage/5caddb19e44c25035a1a1b94/bracket/4
</tt>
<p>
The bit you need to input here in the form is the part between <tt>/stage/</tt> and <tt>/bracket</tt>.  In this case it's <tt>5caddb19e44c25035a1a1b94</tt>.  Put that in the Bracket ID field below, click 'Get Status' and you should get the list of Ongoing matches as well as 2-0 matches where one of the players did not check in.
<p>
Use this information for good, not for evil.
