<h1>Missing URL Error Page</h1>
If you're here, it means the Match Status script hasn't been updated with the Battlefy tournament URLs.
<p>
To fix this, reach out to Dylan Northrup on Discord (@Dylan#2405) and tell him "I got the Missing URL Error Page. Please Update the Match Status script with tournament info from the Tournaments Tab of the Master Tracker spreadsheet."  He will know what that means and will sort it out as soon as he can.
