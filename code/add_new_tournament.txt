# Things to do when a new "on demand" tournament is run.

1. Get links from whoever ran the tournament (right now, they're now listed in the Master Tracker spreadsheet)
2. Two options:
   a. Paste those into the appropriate links file, then run the transform command
   b. Manually update the tournament_urls.rb file.  This was what I did when I initially did this process, for more visibility/understanding
3. Update the database with the new tournament info
   > ./insert_new_tournament_list.rb
4. Manually do the databse update for top 5 stuff (this is done automatically by cron, but do it now so we know if there are any problems sooner rather than later)
   > ./updater.rb
5. Look at top 8 tracker and verify you see the tournament brackets showing up and some of the players who top 8'd in those tournaments are listed in the output
6. Kick back and enjoy a tall, frosty beverage.
