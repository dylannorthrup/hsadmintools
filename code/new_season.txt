# Things to do for new season

0. Back up current database info for old top 8 scripts
   mysql> TRUNCATE old_bracket_tracker;
   mysql> TRUNCATE old_tournament_list;
   mysql> INSERT INTO old_bracket_tracker SELECT * FROM bracket_tracker;
   mysql> INSERT INTO old_tournament_list SELECT * FROM tournament_list;
   mysql> \q
1. Copy links from the Master Tracker speadsheet
1.5 Find out the name of the new season according to Battlefy. Do this and look for most recent tournament.
   > curl https://majestic.battlefy.com/hearthstone-masters/invitees | jq -rc '.[] | .tourStop' | sort | uniq -c
   It will be the one with the fewest items.
2. Paste those links into a file (e.g. "indonesia.links" for the indonesia qualifiers)
3. Transform those to be usable by the programs
   > cat indonesia.links | ./transform-tournament-urls.sh | tee tournament_urls.rb
4. Update the database with the new tournament info
   > ./insert_new_tournament_list.rb
5. Manually do the databse update for top 5 stuff (this is done automatically by cron, but do it now so we know if there are any problems sooner rather than later)
   > ./updater.rb
6. Update the @tour_stop variable in 'hsm.rb' and 'hs_methods.rb' 
7. Find the scheduled date of the last tournament and add a calendar reminder to check for new season info and to do the tools update.
8. If the tournaments are in person, add a calendar reminder for the week after the event so the two on-demand events can be added to the tournament list when they happen.
9. Kick back and enjoy a tall, frosty beverage.
