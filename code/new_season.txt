# Things to do for new season

1. Copy links from the Master Tracker speadsheet
2. Paste those links into a file (e.g. "indonesia.links" for the indonesia qualifiers)
3. Transform those to be usable by the programs
   > cat indonesia.links | ./transform-tournament-urls.sh | tee tournament_urls.rb
4. Update the database with the new tournament info
   > ./insert_new_tournament_list.rb
5. Manually do the databse update for top 5 stuff (this is done automatically by cron, but do it now so we know if there are any problems sooner rather than later)
   > ./updater.rb
6. Kick back and enjoy a tall, frosty beverage.
